# Goodreads

## Intro

This repository is a UI focused redesign of Goodreads. Here is a [link] (https://www.goodreads.com/) for the current website. The design was presented as Illustrator mock ups in small, medium, and large viewing device sizes for responsive capabilities once coded. The Illustrator files are saved as PDF's for ease in viewing within GitHub.

The majority of the work on this redesign was completed within one week, with updates and edits ongoing.
